This project is a fully tested e-commerce application featuring a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The system is designed to ensure reliability, maintainability, and smooth deployment through automated workflows. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is incorporated to validate functionality before integration, ensuring each part of the application works as expected. The React components are backed by unit tests that verify rendering, user interaction, and state updates, creating a stable foundation for continued development. An additional integration test confirms that the cart updates correctly when items are added, reflecting real user behavior and validating multi-component interactions.

A GitHub Actions workflow powers the CI pipeline, automatically running on pushes to the main branch. This workflow installs dependencies, builds the application, and runs all Jest tests to guarantee code quality before deployment. If any test fails, the workflow stops immediately, preventing faulty code from being merged or deployed. This continuous feedback loop enforces code quality standards and prevents regressions.

Once all tests pass successfully, the CD pipeline deploys the application to Vercel. GitHub Actions handles this deployment step as part of the same workflow, ensuring a seamless transition from development to production. This automated deployment flow ensures that only stable and validated builds reach the live environment. The result is a modern, production-ready e-commerce platform with reliable testing, fully automated CI/CD, and streamlined deployment.
