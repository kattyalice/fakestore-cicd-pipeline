This project is a front-end e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase Authentication. The focus of the project is implementing a functional UI that supports user authentication and product browsing, while organizing the application using modern front-end patterns such as Context API, Redux Toolkit, and modular component architecture. The app initializes Firebase through a simple firebase.ts file, where the Firebase project configuration is loaded and the authentication service is exported for login, registration, and logout features.

The codebase is structured around clean separation of concerns. Authentication logic is handled inside AuthContext.tsx, which wraps the app and exposes user state and auth functions to all components. Product-related state is managed separately inside ProductContext.tsx, while the shopping cart uses Redux Toolkit (cartSlice.tsx) for predictable state updates. Pages and components such as Navbar and ProductCard consume these contexts and Redux slices using custom hooks defined in hooks.ts. All UI styling is organized inside a dedicated styles folder to keep presentation separate from logic.

Although no backend CRUD system or Firestore integration is implemented in this version, the project establishes the full front-end foundation needed for an e-commerce experience—routing, authentication flow, product display components, cart state management, and reusable contexts. This makes the app ready for future expansion into Firestore product storage, order history, and complete user profile management if desired.
